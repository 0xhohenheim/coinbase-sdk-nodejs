### Quickstart template for Platform SDK

This is a template repository for quickly getting started with the Platform SDK. It provides a simple example of how to use the SDK.

To set up the template, run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This command will create a developer-custodial wallet, deposit testnet funds to it and perform a transfer to another wallet.
